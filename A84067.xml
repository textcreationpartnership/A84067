            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I have many things to ſay unto you, which yet you cannot bear, but you muſt; becauſe 'tis a burden which the Lord layes on you, and a burden which the Prophets have foretold upon

            <p>The firſt, onely I would now convince you, that you and I, with all the Saints this day, are ſtill in <hi>Babylon,</hi> both gathered <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>ſcattered Saints;</hi>

            <p>Yea, I proved it plain at <hi>Bridgend,</hi> that you are not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to <hi>baptize or be baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>How have you <hi>the faith of the Goſpel,</hi> ſince the <hi>Goſpel is a Myſtery</hi> which none of you know, having not that <hi>manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Spirit</hi> whereby 'twas made known at firſt to the Apoſtles and <hi>Primitive Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118240:4"/>Goſpel. No that's prayer; but the Goſpel to be preached, ſaith he is,<note place="margin">Math. 7.14.</note> 
               <hi>Straight is the Gate, and narrow is the Way that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to life, and few there be that finde it;</hi> for ſo 'tis written in the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> Sure this was not Goſpel and glad tydings to all people, that ſo few ſhould be ſaved; and yet I could ſhew in the Spirit the Goſpel of Salvation, of Life, and Love in that Letter, though few finde it, or the way to it, as Chriſt tells them.</p>
            <p>Again ſaid the good Man, this is another part of the Goſpel, <hi>As many as received him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>to them he gave power to become the ſons of God, even to thoſe that believed in his name.</hi> For ſo 'tis written in the Goſpel of Saint <hi>John,</hi> ſaith he; as if all were Goſple which is written in the Evangeliſts; whereas Chriſt was a <hi>Miniſter of the Circumciſion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15.8.</note> or legal Teacher. Secondly, the Goſple that he taught was but in part, that which was proper onely to the Jewiſh Church,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.24.</note> not that to be preached to the world. Thirdly, what Goſpel or glad tydings is it to tell the world, that none ſhould be ſaved but the Elect and Believers? whereas Chriſt came to <hi>ſave onely the loſt,</hi> giving a word of life to all men,<note place="margin">Act. 13.48, 47,</note> that they <hi>might believe,</hi> or <hi>ſhutting up all in unbeliefe, that he might have mercy upon all,</hi> Rom. 11.32.</p>
            <p>But the Man thought there was no Goſpel, but what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Goſpel of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe men you muſt know are Miniſters of the Goſpel, theſe are the Itinerants in Wales, who know no further of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel then that, or what is written in the Epiſtles: whereas theſe were not that Goſpel which the Apoſtles preached to the world, but proper to the Churches onely, to whom thoſe Letters were written.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt, as I ſaid before, being a Miniſter of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, or legal Teacher, taught the Goſpel (as 'twas alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law) darkly in <hi>types and figures,</hi> in <hi>parables and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Mat.</hi> 13.35. <hi>John</hi> 16.25.</p>
            <p>Again, 'twas his deſign then to do ſo to the Jewiſh Church, to <hi>confound them</hi> the more,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.13, 14, 15.</note> to <hi>blind them,</hi> and <hi>harden them,</hi> that they might not hear any thing, but for their owne deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as I am perſwaded the myſtery of Chriſt, and of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

            <p>Thirdly, as the <hi>rejecting</hi> of the Jewiſh Church was a way for the <hi>receiving</hi> and call of the Nations; ſo the <hi>fall</hi> of the Churches this day, is for the <hi>riſing</hi> of the world,<note place="margin">Iſa. 2.3, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to turn to our Welſh Teacher before mentioned: the man it ſeems afterward bethought himſelf, and was aſhamed of what he ſaid; and therefore followed me to my <hi>Inn,</hi> deſiring to be friends with me; which I ever was, and am ſtil to him and to all men alſo.</p>
            <p>But ſee how unconſtant and unquiet the poor creature was; for becauſe he had then with his Clamors confounded the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, and to his power made that which I had ſpoken in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to be of no effect, or forgoten: I promiſed to ſpeak once more to my honeſt Country-men there in that place, a fortnight after; when he coming there again, ſtept up before me to preach in Welſh; whom yet I quietly heard all the time, till he had end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Sermon, not contradicting him at all, though <hi>I</hi> could in many things, and in moſt.</p>
            <p>Afterward I began to ſpeak to the Engliſh, (for many of the Welſh underſtood) declaring ſomething concerning the glorious appearance of the great God in the laſt dayes; that he would ſo appear in man, that men ſhould be made like him, that God would be both a Heaven and a Hell to men, that moſt men ſhould be in a Hell upon earth, as that ſome ſhould have a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here; I mean the inhabitants of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the onely thing I was alwaies upon, to my dear Country. I alſo ſpake of Gods coming forth as Fire in the laſt times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but had no ſooner finiſhed my diſcourſe, but the Gentleman ſtarts up again, and begins to contradict and withſtand my words the ſecond time, to the trouble and tumult of the company; who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118240:5"/>being ſtrange to ſuch open affronts, and publique conteſts in the Church, began to forget what they heard before, and to riſe up on their ſeats, as if they were to ſee a ſhew.</p>
            <p>Upon this, without anſwering a word, I went out of the place in ſilence, leaving the man to ſpeak what he pleas'd to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but as I was going out of the Church, he turning about and crying after me I anſwered no more but this word unto him; Mr. <hi>Davys,</hi> you will be ſhortly in the Fire (for the fire was that I then had ſpoken of) and ſo I departed in peace.</p>
            <p>But (as I ſaid before) let all men judge from that aforeſaid, whether ſuch men are fit to be Miniſters of the Goſpel, who think the Goſpel to be that, which is written in the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, or in the Apoſtles Epiſtles; whereas the one is but an Hiſtorical relation, or report of Chriſt in his life and death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Epiſtles are only particular Letters of ſome ſpecial concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Churches, not that which the Apoſtles preached to the world; and as Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion in the days of his fleſh, while he was alive on earth: ſo Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preached the Goſpel indeed,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.17.</note> till after he was dead; then he came <hi>forth in the Spirit preaching peace,</hi> &amp;c. in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
            <p>And the Goſpel which the Apoſtles preached to the world, 'twas not that which they wrote to the Churches, nor yet what they read in the Scriptures of the Prophets (for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was this to the Heathens, to tell them of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Pſalmes?</hi>) But the Goſpel was a Myſtery, which in the light of God, they could manifeſt to men, and make all men ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in God, that's in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yet moſt of the Independent and Baptized preachers of the Goſpel, know no farther of the <hi>Myſtery,</hi> then what is written in the letter of Scripture eſpecially in the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> or <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> whence they can onely <hi>take their Goſpel-texts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed Chriſt being a <hi>Miniſter of the Circumciſion,</hi> and preaching the Goſpel in part (as I ſaid) in a legal manner took a <hi>text of Scripture</hi> out of the Prophets; as the Apoſtles alſo preaching to the Jewes made uſe of the Scripture to them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.27. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. compare.</p>
            <p>But preaching <hi>the Goſpel to the world,</hi> they neither mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118240:5"/>Scripture, nor ſpake from a text;<note place="margin">Act. 14.17. Act. 17.27, 21.</note> for what was <hi>Moſes and David, and the Prophets</hi> to thoſe who never heard of ſuch men, nor owned their writings? though indeed indited by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. which <hi>Spirit moved</hi> thoſe who ſpake the ſame.</p>
            <p>This I only ſpeak, to ſhew the <hi>Ignorance, or inconſiderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds</hi> of our Goſpel-preachers, who know not what they ſay, nor the way they go, nor the work they do, nor the word they ſpeak, nor the Goſpel which they pretend to preach unto the world.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I now write to the baptized Churches, I would convince them alſo of this, that they are not the true, nor can baptize in truth, having not a Goſpel yet manifeſt among them: I ſay not manifeſt, for there may be a ſeed of it in them, as alſo was in legal Saints. I will not minde you of thoſe two Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, mentioned in the following diſpute, <hi>John</hi> 7.38, 39. and <hi>John</hi> 14.12. nor yet a third proof, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16, 17. <hi>Hee that believeth and is baptixed ſhall be ſaved, and theſe ſigns ſhall follow them that believe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>ſignes did follow</hi> Goſpel-believers,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.7. 1 Cor. 12.7. compare.</note> at leaſt every <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Church of believers,</hi> in whoſe members as that faith was <hi>manifeſted;</hi> ſo eſpecially in the <hi>Miniſters or Elders,</hi> who by laying on of <hi>hands on the ſick,</hi> and by <hi>prayer of faith, could ſave the ſick from death.</hi> The Oyle then uſed being not a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical receipt, or chirurgical ſalve, nor yet an empty Ceremony, but a <hi>ſigne of the Spirits preſence in the Church,</hi> and power in the Elder to heal the body as well as the ſoul, <hi>James</hi> 5.14, 15.</p>
            <p>I will not mention that other <hi>laying on of the Presbytery or Elderſhip,</hi> in ordaining by a <hi>gift of the Spirit</hi> ever given there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14. 2 Tim. 1.6. compare.</note> as (with God) I ſhall ſhew hereafter, onely now 'tis clear, there is no Goſpel-faith in all the Churches this day.</p>
            <p>Know then that in the <hi>Churches of Chriſt,</hi> there was both the <hi>gift of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>grace of Faith;</hi> the one in ſome Church-members (as well as in Miniſters) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was common to all believers; though ſome that were carnal then in Goſpel-Churches, had but a legal faith, becauſe carnal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12, 13. compare.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Goſpel-faith</hi> ſuitable to that preſent ſtate of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118240:6"/>and ſpiritual Saints; it was (though not <hi>differing,</hi> yet) <hi>diverſe</hi> from the legal faith of Gods people under the Law: true faith was ever the ſame for ſubſtance, but not for manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the <hi>Goſpel is everlaſting,</hi> and Chriſt the ſame to day, yeſterday and for ever.</p>
            <p>But as Chriſt was onely vayled in the Law, and revealed in the Goſpel; ſo the Goſpel and Chriſt Jeſus were both <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries hid ſince the world began from the Sons of men,</hi> yea from the ſons of God-under the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. compare.</p>
            <p>This Myſtery was not manifeſt till to the Apoſtles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Saints by the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>That Spirit was not given before, yea <hi>the Spirit</hi> was not at all, as the Greek there reads, <hi>John</hi> 7.39.</p>
            <p>And ſo that Spirit is not now, not the <hi>Baptiſme of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which the Apoſtles themſelves had not,<note place="margin">John 20.22. Act. 1.5. compare.</note> while Chriſt was with them in fleſh; and though after his reſurrection he <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the Spirit on them,</hi> yet they were not, baptized with the Spirit, till afterward. Before which given, they could not go forth to Teach all Nations, and Baptize in a Goſpel-way, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Goſpel-Believers</hi> could not be before the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of the Spirit;</hi> that is, the pouring forth the gifts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, on the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.33, 44. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 9. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</p>
            <p>Beſides, as the object of a Goſpel-faith was a myſtery, that's <hi>Chriſt in us the hope of glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 4.20. Col. 1.27. Gal. 1.15. and 2.20. compare. 1 Cor. 2.2, 7, 10, 12, 13. verſ. compare.</note> the Son of God revealed in us, living in us, <hi>and dying in us, and we crucified with him</hi> (for both <hi>Chriſt and him crucified</hi> alſo was a myſtery, as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the object of that faith) ſo this Goſpel-faith was a myſtery likewiſe; the <hi>myſtery of Faith in a pure conſcience,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.9.</p>
            <p>But the object of a <hi>Legal faith</hi> was no myſtery, but a plain <hi>promiſe,</hi> or <hi>God in covenant, not God in Chriſt;</hi> for this the Apoſtles themſelves knew not in the dayes of his fleſh: <hi>Yee believe in God (ſaith he) believe alſo in me,</hi> &amp;c. Legal Saints believed on God, not on Chriſt, (for Chriſt was a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery not yet manifeſt) or to <hi>believe on God by Chriſt</hi> is that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118240:6"/>which believing Chriſtians this day know not, nor conſider. For what's this? why firſt, 'tis to know Chriſt <hi>in the Father, and the Father in him,</hi> and he in us, and we in him, <hi>John</hi> 14.20. Secondly, to know Chriſt as the way to the Father for us, verſ. 6.7. how ſo? <hi>he that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me; and he that ſeeth me, ſeeth him that ſent me,</hi> that's the Father in me, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.44, 45. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.9. compared. What's that? 'tis thus to me, he that <hi>ſees God in Chriſt, and the Father in him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Emanuel, God with us, that's Chriſt.</hi> Mat. 1.23. Eph. 3.19. John 17.23. compare.</note> may as well <hi>ſee God even the Father in himſelf;</hi> for Chriſt is in us, and we in Chriſt, that is God in our fleſh as in Chriſts; for <hi>Chriſt and we are perfect in one,</hi> one with the Father; thus he is the way to the Father, and thus by him (as the way) we <hi>believe on God, who raiſed him from the dead and gave him glory, that our faith and hope might be in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. So that in truth, to believe on Chriſt, is not to believe on Chriſt, but on the Father in him, God in his fleſh, and in ours alſo; for our faith does tend, and end in God, yet through him and by him, as I ſaid before.</p>
            <p>So that here's the <hi>misbeliefe of Churches</hi> this day; their faith is onely on God <hi>as the Iews,</hi> or only on Chriſt as deceived Chriſtians, not on God and Chriſt, or on God by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And by this it appears, there has not been in the Churches a Goſpel-faith, at leaſt formally, for vertually there might be in ſome, but <hi>formally and effectually there has not been a Goſpel-faith in the Saints</hi> theſe 1400 years: for what ſign has follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any that believed? who could ever <hi>ſhew the Gift of Faith,</hi> when the grace of Faith was ſcarce known? what mountain or mighty thing has been done,<note place="margin">Mark 6.17. Mat. 17.20. Mat. 21.21. compare. Joſh. 6.13.</note> or done away and removed meerly by Faith? for an outward force and ſtrength of man has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies attended great acts in latter times; but where's the fall of <hi>Iericho's</hi> walls by rams-horns? or <hi>Gideons</hi> conqueſt by bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pitchers, and <hi>lights held up in his hand?</hi> Oh this new light believers are afraid of,<note place="margin">Judg. 7.20.</note> or to hear the ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</p>
            <p>All things, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>what ſoever ye ſhall ask in prayer, believing, ye ſhall receive it;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Matth. 21.22.</note> asking in faith nothing wavering <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though the man want wiſdom, yet he ſhall have it liberally given him of God, ſaith <hi>Iames:</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 1.5, 6.</note> how then are they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118240:7"/>who pray moſt the greateſt fools, both Papiſts and Proteſtants? then is not the wiſeſt man as a wave of the Sea, when the Sea is over the whole earth,<note place="margin">Iſa. 4.11.</note> and the beſt are in the waters?</p>
            <p>Truly we are all ſick, let us ſend then to the Elders of the Church, and ſee if they have the prayer of faith to heal us, or heal themſelves from the ſtroke of their wound, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.17.</p>
            <p>Who among all the gathered Churches can hold forth a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-faith to the <hi>ſcattered Saints?</hi> who of all their <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters</hi> can go forth freely to the world?<note place="margin">Col. 24.15. 1 Pet. 1.12.</note> where is the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from on high,</hi> or <hi>holy Spirit ſent downe from heaven,</hi> for that work?</p>
            <p>Yea, where's the Spirit of Faith in any of their Believers? <hi>Goſpel-believers were all of one heart and one ſoul,</hi> becauſe but <hi>one body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2.44. Act. 4.32.</note> &amp;c. ours are all divided: believers then had all things common, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> our Churches and Chriſtians are all for <hi>ſelf-intereſts,</hi> and to <hi>ſeek their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not love, as I ſhall ſhew anon, nor faith indeed which works by love.</p>
            <p>All have not faith, ſaith the Apoſtle in thoſe Goſpel-times: no man has a Goſpel-faith in theſe times of the Apoſtacy, and being of the Saints in Babylons captivity.</p>
            <p>Yet this is the confuſion that hath ever followed the Churches to this day, to take up the Apoſtles words and writings, and to apply that to our ſelves, which was poſſible to thoſe times, and proper only to primitive Saints and Churches, where that power was, which is now wanting to all the world.</p>
            <p>Thus the Baptiſts now take up the <hi>Apoſtles call and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which was never given them by Chriſt much leſs by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit afterward.</p>
            <p>Again, like the Angel of darkneſs (or Devil) cutting off part of Gods word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſtill tell their Proſelytes,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.6. Mat. 28.19.</note> 
               <hi>Go teach and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,</hi> &amp;c. whereas 'tis written, <hi>Go Teach all Nations, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, 'twas not directed to the Diſciples, but to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles upon this ground, and the Eleven are mentioned by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>Mark:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28.16. Mark 16.14.</note> for every Diſciple had not that power from on high, to Teach all Nations.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118240:7"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Who can ſhew unto us that he is ſent of God to Baptize? ſeeing none baptized but either the Apoſtles, or ſuch who had a manifeſtation of the Spirit, to confirm their call,<note place="margin">Act. 8.6. Act. 9.17.</note> as <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Ananias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, 'Twere well if they would not onely chuſe their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by a confeſſion of faith, but catechiſe them, and themſelves firſt, in the doctrine of Faith.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>myſtery of Faith</hi> was more then men imagine, and it may be more then <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and Churches of <hi>Galatia:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 4.2.</note> for both it ſeems had gone ſo far back to the Law <hi>(to begin in the Spirit and end in the fleſh)</hi> that the Apoſtle goes no farther then a <hi>Legal Faith:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.3.</note> for <hi>Faith as juſtifying</hi> was no more; and Faith on the promiſe was no higher then their Faith under the Law, as is proved in the diſpute hereafter.</p>
            <p>Goſpel-Faith was wholly exerciſed in our union with God in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us; which <hi>Paul</hi> rather points at in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then teacheth the Church, unleſs what he hints to ſome <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Saints therein,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> who had the <hi>anointing in them teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all things, that they needed not any man ſhould teach them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 2.27.</note> Therefore as Chriſt never heard any man preach; ſo neither did the Apoſtles hear one anothers preachings, or ſit at a Sermon, as our Goſpel-preachers do.</p>
            <p>This I onely ſpeak by the way at preſent and another thing, that the Apoſtles never preach'd a common place of the nature of Faith or repentance to bring people to repeat and believe, but ſo preached Chriſt to all, that they might believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>Goſpel-Faith properly was this, in <hi>knowing our followſhip with the Father and the Son in the Spirit,</hi> to know our union with God in Chriſt, and Chriſt ſo in us, that we are in one with the Father, as He, in the ſame love and life in God with him. <hi>John</hi> 14.19. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.1, 20, 21, 22, 23. now the <hi>myſtery of God, even the Father and of Chriſt</hi> was not manifeſt to any under the Law, nor to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, who though he ſaw the day of Chriſt, yet 'twas a far off,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.56. Heb. 11.13.</note> for ſo the Fathers ſaluted <hi>the promiſes;</hi> whoſe Faith was on the promiſe or power of God in performing the ſame, and ſo its juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14. to 21. but the juſtifying faith of Chriſtians was on Chriſt dying
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118240:8"/>and raiſed up, verſe 24.25. though <hi>Abraham</hi> in a typical myſtery believed on Chriſt dead and raiſed in his ſon ſacrificed and ſlain in purpoſe verſe 17. and raiſed in a figure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.19. But as Chriſt was a myſtery, ſo his death and reſurrection was a myſtery alſo, that none but the Apoſtles could manifeſt it by the Spirit; which being not given to any one living, the Faith which comes by hearing is no higher then theirs under the Law, to juſtify and to ſave; yea we know by experience, the beſt Preachers when they would raiſe men to believe, pitch them on the promiſe, not on that power from on high, or promiſe of the Father, which they that believed on Chriſt did receive, and by which the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel brought men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>But take faith in the loweſt acceptance (for juſtifying Faith was but of a legal temper) which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to fall from, the Apoſtle is faine to ſet before them the <hi>faith of Abraham and David</hi> &amp;c, (to whom the <hi>myſtery of Chriſt and of the Goſpel being not yet manifeſted by the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.13. Rom. 4.3, 6.</note> as to the Apoſtles and primitive Saints) that Faith of theirs was but ſuitable to a legal eſtate (I ſay) take Faith in the loweſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as juſtifying before God and men, as working by love, where is it? when there is no love among you, neither to other Churches or Saints differing from you, nor <hi>to your own Churces</hi> who differ in doctrine (as I ſaid before) much leſs <hi>love to all Saints,</hi>

            <p>Truely this want of love to all men, ſhewes you have no true love among your ſelves, no love unfeigned, out of a pure heart, fervently one to another. You ſpeak much of the command of Chriſt for baptiſme, but let me ask you one queſtion, why do yee not obey all the commands of Chriſt in his Apoſtles yea what he commanded himſelf? <hi>Paul and Peter</hi> laid this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>Greet yee one another with a holy Kiſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. greet ye one another with a kiſs of love, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.14. The Papiſts have a Pax to repreſent this,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118240:9"/>for all muſt kiſs the <hi>Pax</hi> when they come to Maſs, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>this kiſs of love:</hi> but ye (brethren) have not ſo much as a ſhew of this; leſs love among the Brethren then among Popiſh Churches: how can you diſpenſe with his Apoſtolique <hi>command of Chriſt?</hi> how can ye omit this <hi>kiſs of love?</hi> will ye ſay of this, as ye do of the gifts of the Spirit, that 'twas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary onely for thoſe Apoſtolique Churches? this indeed is the Popiſh diſtinction, which Proteſtants have learnt from them: but we have prov'd before, that thoſe ſpiritual gifts were commanded to be followed, becauſe for the edifying of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.</p>
            <p>If thoſe gifts were extraordinary, are Goſpel-graces ſo? for that faith you cannot ſhew, nor their love we cannot ſee, not a ſhew of it: for where's the <hi>kiſs of love</hi> ſo oft commanded? 'twas not a Courtly ceremony, nor a wanton kiſs, but a <hi>holy kiſs the kiſs of love 'twas;</hi> when ſpiritual Saints at the ſight of each other (eſpecially coming together as one body to break bread, as the body of Chriſt) ſaluted one another with a kiſt, with a hearty kiſs they hug'd each other, they embraced and kiſs when they met, as if their ſouls would move forth and meet together at the lips: for as they were <hi>all of one heart and one ſoul,</hi> ſo their ſoul ſaluted at each others lips;<note place="margin">Act. 4.32.</note> that was their <hi>fervent love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again, where are your <hi>feaſts of love,</hi> that were once in the Churches of Chriſt? love is a ſtranger to you, you know it not, nor the feaſts of love what they were,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.8. Jude 12. compare.</note> wherein they did not <hi>coenare coenam ſed diſciplinam</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells you.</p>
            <p>This ſhewes the falling away is come upon you and that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy foretold by the Apoſtles is come upon you in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having no gift of the Spirit, nor yet the grace of Faith; which becauſe 'tis a ſecret thing and hidden in the heart, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo eaſily be convinced of; but love is a viſible glory that may be ſeen of men yea faith alſo; for <hi>ſhew me thy faith by thy works:</hi> and as faith works by love,<note place="margin">James 2.8.</note> ſo the labour of love cannot poſſible be hid but 'twill appear to all; but in you it doth not: therefore the firſt appearance of the <hi>Apoſtacie or falling away</hi> of the Churches, was in <hi>leaving their firſt love;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2.4.</note> for as the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> were types of the Apoſtolique
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118240:10"/>Churches enclining to an Apoſtacy: ſo <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the firſt, is charged with this,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.26.</note> that ſhe was <hi>fallen from her firſt love,</hi> as <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the laſt (being the Type of theſe laſt Churches) is commended for nothing, but condemned altogether, for want of <hi>zeal or fervent love;</hi> though the <hi>Baptiſme of the Spirit and of fire,</hi> was that eſpecially wanting in that Church, and in all this day, who are not hot, nor have any Spiritual gift at all; yea, nor any grace of the Goſpel, as I ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe, Chriſt fore-told, that at his comming, <hi>Becauſe iniquity ſhould abound,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 24.12.</note> 
               <hi>the love of many would wax cold:</hi> Noting, firſt, that iniquity would abound in the Churches, as to be carnal, covetous, unclean, proud, and peeviſh, without faith or love. Secondly, men looking upon Churches in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would have but cold love unto them, whoſe love is ſo cold one to another. But thirdly, here's the <hi>height of love,</hi> (the love of ſuch who are ſaved from the Apoſtacy) to love thoſe in whom <hi>iniquity abounds,</hi> to love the <hi>Churches, though ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity abounds among them;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.7.</note> for love <hi>believes all things,</hi> and hopes all things; believes the beſt of all, and hopes they will be better.</p>
            <p>But yet there is one mark of love I have not mentioned, that's Chriſts love, not in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth; pray what's that? 'Tis 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our life for our brethren.</hi> Here's firſt a Myſtery that men know not, how God did lay down his life: for the death of the man Chriſt, all conceive; but how that man was nothing but God manifeſt in fleſh, and how <hi>God ſhed his blood,</hi> crucifying that fleſh to himſelf, is the Myſtery of Chriſt and him crucified, not known to the Churches: but becauſe God laid down his life for us, we ought to lay down our life for the brethren; Heer's <hi>love to the brotherhood:</hi> and mark it, this love is commanded, as well as baptiſme; <hi>we ought ſo to love</hi> the brethren, as to dye for them.</p>
            <p>Oh that my dear baptized brethren could once dye to their own life, their living in the world according to Ordinances, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20. Ordinances that ſhall be proved (with God) not to be of a Goſpel-appointment or power: will you not die to theſe? if
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118240:10"/>it be proved unto you, that having not the baptiſme of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and of fire in your Church, you have no power to baptize with water; I mean, in a Goſpel way. Secondly, that there is no true Adminiſtrator ſent of God to baptize. Thirdly, that Water-baptiſme was not by dipping, but by waſhing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples feet, called Believers going down to the waters up to the Ankles.</p>
            <p>Oh that you could dye to your own life, to fleſh and blood, to that reaſon and underſtanding of yours, raiſed on the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men!</p>
            <p>Yea, that ye could dye to your own credit, content, comforts; truly 'twill not be to your credit to diſown and lay down your Principles and practice of dipping ſo long continued.</p>
            <p>I know you have much content and comfort in your perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances and gathered Churches, while many ſcattered Saints are mourning over your Formes, and their own fleſh, yea to the fleſh of Chriſt being dead unto them;<note place="margin">Ioh. 16, 7.</note> as the Diſciples did at <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Chriſt,</hi> when that <hi>pure fleſh of his muſt ſuffer wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and weakneſs,</hi> and his fleſh be taken from them, they had ſorrow <hi>of heart,</hi> while <hi>the world</hi> did rejoyce; that is,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.20.

            <p>And not onely for himſelf, but he waited when all the Saints ſhould riſe with him in the Body; for then the Body of the Lord, the dead Body of Chriſt, is raiſed out of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Brethren, we all in theſe dayes are not onely his dead Body as the legal and Goſpel-Churches were, but we are the dead Body in <hi>Babylon;</hi> yea we are dry bones, very dry; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, but long dead, for many hundred of years the Churches have been ſo, ever ſince the Apoſtacie; which Apoſtacie is now manifeſtly revealed in the Churches: I ſay, we are dry bones, not onely the dead body, as Goſpel-Churches were, who had the fleſh of Chriſt on them, and the Spirit of Chriſt in them; I mean the manifeſtation of the Spirit in manifold Gifts; for that was the Spirit which Jeſus gave when he was glorified, which we have not, and therefore are dry Bones.</p>
            <p>Againe, we have no fleſh, not the fleſh of Chriſt on us, I mean his crucified fleſh (for that the Goſpel-Churches had, and glorifyed in it) but the <hi>Croſs is a thing now we cannot abide to bear;</hi> as if we had taſted the delicacies of the Whore,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.3.

            <p>Thirdly, I ſhewed we have not the fleſh of Chriſt in us, not the <hi>Faith of the Son of God, nor that love in the Spirit,</hi> nor ſo much as Scripture for any of our Goſpel-Ordinances, as I have and ſhall prove (with God) another time.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we are dry Bones, very dry indeed, if our Faith be dead, and no Goſpel-Faith nor yet any knowledge, ſo much as of the Ordinances we live in: for which of the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all this while, that Baptiſm and Breaking of bread did hold forth nothing elſe (even to Goſpel-Saints) but the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Lord, which they alſo were indeed?</p>

            <p>Oh brethren, ſee your ſelves at laſt <hi>the dead body of the Lord,</hi> for then you ſhall ariſe and live; <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live together, with my dead body they ſhall ariſe; awake, and ſing, ye that dwell in the duſt,</hi> (that's dry bones) <hi>Iſai</hi> 26.19. This cannot be meant of the laſt reſurrection when all ſhall riſe; for here ſome ſhall not riſe, <hi>v.</hi> 14. but you brethren ſhall riſe; when? as ſoon as you are become the <hi>dead body of the Lord,</hi> for ſo the words are read, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, my dead body they ſhall ariſe;</hi> that is, when we ſee our ſelves the <hi>dead body of the Lord,</hi> we riſe and live immediately in the midſt of death, and <hi>ſing in the duſt;</hi> yea, though dry bones, and in the loweſt eſtate of fleſh, we can comfortably wait for the Spirit, and for the comming of the Lord in us, that by the ſame Spirit which raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>dead body,</hi> we the <hi>dead body of the Lord</hi> may be raiſed up together with him.</p>
            <p>Truly brethren, the living God knows, that all I have written, or ſhall, is not intended by me to trouble your walkings, but to give our reſt in the Lord alone at laſt; not meerly to throw down your Churches, or for your fall, but to raiſe you up, that we all may live together with Chriſt in God.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Milk and Honey (ever remembred freind) which formerly I ſucked in your Miniſtration, makes me apt to conclude that your pit is not dryed up, nor your root withered, but that the intern Spirit of the inward heaven doth raign in you in the night. It's many years ſince I looked on you as an Image;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118240:14"/>I never heard (nor had a line) from you (as ſome hereabout had.) It may be you thought me leſs teachable, and more uncapable of underſtanding then ſome others; indeed I am ſo. I knew not where to direct a line to finde you by reaſon of your private life, which to ſome is ſafe and ſerene, and to others tempeſtuous and dangerous.</p>
               <p>The Hermite is not very uſefull to man or beaſt (nor the Chriſt to him) becauſe Talents will ruſt and rot the living creature, unleſs they be thrown out of your private cheſt and ſhip. The Prophets, Apoſtles <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſpake to God (the Eternity) liſtened to him; and ſpake from him, they writ, they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they charged their Ambaſſage, as the heavenly true Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpake to them; and that creature was ever the baſeſt, that did trade leaſt between the mother (the heavenly nature and angelical world) and the ſinfull children of men (now out of Paradiſe, wandring in the heart of this ſhadowy world.) The more you be in the heavenly action (which is publique alſo to millions every day in the year) the more like the God of all beings, and inhabitant of eternity. I do both long and profeſs to become a little child againe, willing to learne my <hi>A.B.C.</hi> anew, if my once-dear School-maſter <hi>Erbery</hi> can teach it me <hi>(for I muſt not take printed Pictures inſtead of reall Letters.)</hi> I am dayly longing to withdraw into the inner world (the more ſpiritual Chamber) to converſe with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that know how God is the Father of ſpirits, lights, loves, and mercies, in his begotten Word and generated Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. I deſire you (according to your attainment) to help me (I mean to ſcribble a few lines to me) in anſwering theſe things. How is God above all, through all, and in all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? How all things are of him, through and to him? How do we live, move, and have our being in him? what is that hereſie of perdition the holy One (in <hi>Peter</hi>) mentions? and chiefly what, where, when, and how God is?</p>
               <p>I am not aſhamed to enquire, or wait of a meer poſt neer the gate of the wiſdome of God about theſe matters; neither do I diſown you (as ſome ſtrange notioniſt, or ſceptick gnoſtick) in what you in the light of the Father, can or will hold
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118240:14"/>forth, for ſatisfaction by the Spirit; for ſince I knew you, or taſted the wine in you, I ever lodged reſpectful thoughts of you. I fear neither truth nor its enemies; I would try all things (all ſpirits, bodies, and beings in the light, liberty, reſt and power of the Spirit of Jeſus:) and becauſe a ſon of man is but a vanity, a very, glance, a branch, a ſhadow, and off-ſpring of the eternal root; therefore one branch may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſap with the other, and the little little twig (neer the root) doth communicate in juce with the higheſt-flown branch of the ſame tree. I doubt not but the whiſpering of the melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious love from any (though from poor me) might refreſh you under the ſun in this vain vaporary life: This is but a word in haſte and heart, to invite (if it ſeem good) a line from you, and then the few lines (that concern you in my inward book) I may better tranſcribe. My true love (with my wifes) to your ſelf and your rib; begging we may rightly take in, and not miſtake the firſt and ſecond man, and the third form that is at hand. I onely beg of you a ſound about your grounds in Scripture-nature, and in the internal eternal Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Men, Saints, Officers, Ordinances, Churches, and Societies of men. <hi>No more then, but that I am</hi>

               <p>YOurs of the twenty ninth of the fourth month, I received at <hi>Roth</hi> near <hi>Cardiff</hi> this 12 of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and I return an Anſwer in ſilence, ſeeing we are both in the Eternal Spirit, with the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, where there is no need of ſpeech to communicate our thoughts or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments each to other; being taken up into him who is our All, and all in All.</p>
               <p>There the Myſtery of the Reſurrection begins, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle goes on in that heighth from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. to the end; that this is the Reſurrection, not that laſt and general of the world, but the firſt Reſurrection; the riſing of the Saints, or of the dead in Chriſt, who ſhall riſe firſt: I ſay that this is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection onely of the juſt, and not of the unjuſt nor of all; any man (even without the Spirit of Revelation) may judge by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and reading of that Chapter; where the riſing of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual body t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This I call the third diſpenſation, or laſt diſcovery of God unto and in men, differing from Law and Goſpel-order; yet comprehending both, and above both, yea above all: for here all men and things are nothing, but God is all and alone, yea God is All in all.</p>
               <p>This third diſpenſation, as all the Prophets and Apoſtles did write and wait for; ſo in this I wait in ſilence with God (though I ſpeak ſometimes to men) for a full diſcovery of him in me, and to all the Saints with me; for when the Lord my God ſhall come
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118240:15"/>or appear, all the Saints ſhall come with thee, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.5.</p>
               <p>The Earth-quake there ſpoken of is at hand, 'tis the ſame mentioned in <hi>Babylons</hi> final fall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.18, 19. for a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2. and <hi>v.</hi> 21. and that the third or laſt fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> will be in the fall of this form of Church-fellowſhip (ſo called) you may ſee in your ſpirit, and in ſome printed ſcriblings of mine: therefore for Order, Ordinances, Officers, Churches, Societies of men, all are in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in confuſion of Tongues; that's out of order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though many of the Saints conceive they are come to <hi>Sion</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Babylon</hi> is a Myſtery (as you ſhall ſee with God very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>Babylon</hi> or the Beaſt is the myſtery of man,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.18. Rev. 1, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>When this great Trump is blown, thoſe who were ready to periſh in the land of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the out-caſt in the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſhall come and worſhip the Lord in the holy Mount at <hi>Jeruſalem, Iſa.</hi> 27.13.

               <p>There's no building of Temples in <hi>Babylon,</hi> nor joyning there in Church-fellowſhip; for that will fall, and we with it, till we retire alone into our ſelves, or the Spirit rather in us; and this we muſt be,<note place="margin">Zach. 12.12.</note> every man apart by himſelf; every Famlily apart, and their wives apart; man and his wife, though neareſt and deareſt fleſh,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.9.

               <p>In this myſtery of the Reſurrection, all your Queſtions in the Letter will be anſwered, your doubts ſatisfied, your dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cleared, your Captivity ended; for 'tis the glorious liberty of the children of God, the manifeſtation of the ſons of God,<note place="margin">Iſai. 52.8.</note> the appearing of the great God in us, when we ſhall be like him, ſee him as he is, know him as we are known, <hi>ſee him eye to eye;</hi>

               <p>When that day comes, called the day of God, when God ſhall come, that is, appear in us all, then all the Saints ſhall come with him, yea with thee, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.5. How can this be, that all the Saints ſhall come with thee? ſurely thus, when God ſhall come or appear in thee, all the Saints ſhall come or appear with thee in God.</p>
               <p>Therefore as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old was a City in unity,<note place="margin">Pſa. 132.3. Eph. 4.4. Act. 4.32.</note> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact in it ſelf, and as the Apoſtolique Churches or ſpiritual <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> had the unity of the Spirit, and bond of peace, being one body, and ſo having all one heart and one ſoul; ſo in the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> much more unity, peace, and love, will appear in all the Saints one to another, and toward all men.</p>
               <p>Therefore though the City had twelve Gates, yet but one ſtreet; that's ſtrange, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.21. yea the Gates of the City were never ſhut day nor night, but always open to receive all; that's ſtranger yet, verſ. 25. yet ſo it is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.11. compared with verſe 5. to 10. and as but one ſtreet in that City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.2. ſo but one Tree on either ſide of the River, verſe 2. that's as ſtrange, how on both ſides the River ſhould grow but one Tree. True <hi>Ezekiel</hi> being under the legal diſpenſation ſaw many trees; but <hi>John</hi> in the ſecond diſpenſation, ſeeing the third approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaw but one Tree on each ſide the River; one River in the ſtreet, and but one ſtreet in the City; ſo all the Saints, though many in forms and fleſh, ſhall be ſeen in Spirit, one in the Lord, yea one Spirit with the Lord himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:118240:18"/>
               <p>Oh, how many ſtreets are in the great City <hi>Babylon?</hi> how many ſtreets in our Cities below? how many Societies? how many Churches divided in Spirit and in Form alſo, one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and in themſelves? Surely the Saints are in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when their Societies and gathered Churches are become not onely the ſcattered bones, dead; but as the two ſticks,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37.2. verſe 13.</note> divided and dry too; for 'tis but ſticks, not living branches. I call the Churches ſo, not the Saints therein: for the life of grace is in them, though truly it be much hid from others, and hid to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves this day; yea dead in many, and in moſt buried with earth, and earthly mindedneſs. I'll ſay no more.</p>
               <p>My dear Brother, let us wait together for the firſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if by any meanes we may attain unto it,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.6.</note> that the dead in Chriſt may riſe firſt, that the dead and divided Saints may riſe out of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 37.12, 23.</note> that God may bring us out of our Graves of forms and fleſh, being defiled in both. I do not by this deny the general Reſurrection that ſhall be, but deſire you, and all the Saints with you, to look for this,<note place="margin">Col. 3.1.</note> that is next and neareſt to you, to riſe not onely from ſin as thoſe under the ſecond diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation were riſen; but to riſe from ſelf, as we ſhall in the third, when God ſhall be all in all, that we may all hear him in us ſpeaking with power, Ariſe, ſhake thy ſelf from the duſt,<note place="margin">Iſa. 52.2.</note> ariſe and ſit down, O <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> looſe thy ſelf from the bands of thy neck, O captive Daughter of <hi>Sion.</hi> Farewell.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Beloved Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Wrote unto you once before I received yours laſt; but mine miſcarried, and 'tis no matter; for the whole contents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of concerned outward things, as Church-Order, Ordinances,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118240:19"/>and Officers; which I proved then not to be of the primitive inſtitution, with power from on high, and appearance of the Spirits preſence in gifts,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.49. Act. 1.4, 5. Act. 21.4, 33.</note> which was the ordinary conſtitution of a Goſpel-Church. Firſt in order, that is, the manifeſtation of the Spirit in manifold gifts, called the Baptiſme of the Spirit, this being the pouring forth of all the gifts of the Spirit;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7, 12. 1 Cor. 14.1, 12.</note> for ſome the Church under the Law had, as gifts of propheſying, ſignes, miracles, raiſing the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the preſent profeſſing Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Churches are far below, even that legal diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Officers of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Act. 14.23. 1 Tim. 4.14. 2 Tim. 1.6. James 5.14. Act. 20.23.</note> were as for number five, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. ſo the loweſt Elder, Paſtor, and Teacher was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained with a gift of the Spirit given by the laying on of hands; by which, as they were enabled for their miniſterial work; ſo were they to abide, and to ſit down with their particular flocks; for the Apoſtles onely were to go forth to the world;<note place="margin">Col. 1.23, 25.</note> as the Evangeliſts were appointed to ordain Eiders in every City,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.5. Act. 13.1, 2, 3.</note> and the Prophets to miniſter unto the Lord in the Churches, laying on their hand on ſuch Apoſtles who were ſucceſſively ſent abroad out of thoſe Churches to preach the Goſpel, with the holy Spirit ſent downe from heaven,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12. Eph. 3.4, 5. Col. 1.27, 28, 29.</note> without which the Myſtery of Chriſt could not be manifeſt to men. This was the full miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt in thoſe five, which the world could not want, nor the Church be without; the want of which, leaves both in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> or confuſion, as it has been all along the Apoſtacie, and is now more viſible this day to many ſcattered Saints.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Ordinances which are in the gathered Churches, are far from the primitive inſtitution in matter and form: For firſt, a Pſalm, a Doctrine, a Tongue, Interpretation, Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were ordinary,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.26.</note> becauſe for edifying, and therefore Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Church of Chriſt; theſe are not now at all; go, the edifice is fallen into confuſion, that's <hi>Babel.</hi> Secondly, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which are as the Childiſh tradition of Childrens Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; the breaking of bread, which ſhould be the Communion of Chriſts body, cannot be adminiſtred; becauſe the body is not onely dead,<note place="margin">Ezek 37.3, 16.</note> as the dry bones of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but divided, as the two ſticks there; and how then can there be a communion, when there is no union of the body? for as there was before in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118240:19"/>Goſpel-ſtate, but one Spirit, one baptiſme; ſo but one body; all believers and Goſpel-Saints walked in one Church-way, one way of worſhip, doctrine and diſcipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and though there was particular diviſions between brother and brother, yet not between Church and Church; for the body was but one, as I ſaid. Now the Saints by calling have diverſe baptiſmes, and are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bodies: how can there be then breaking of bread, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body? 'tis but the bread of Mourners, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9.4. read it in the Spirit.</p>
               <p>I will not ſpeak of our Common-prayers, and cuſtomary car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſinging of Pſalmes; for though Prayers were publiquely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Jewiſh Church, that Church being national,<note place="margin">Act. 2.42.</note> yet in the Goſpel-Churches (being a company of Saints) Prayers were proper onely in the Church (as fellowſhip and breaking of bread was only there) not with the world or multitude; therefore Chriſt and his Apoſtles did never pray with their preaching. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.1, 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.24. compared.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the things I then enlarged to you, in the Letter that was loſt; and truely I intended not now to ſpeak a word of this, when I firſt put pen to paper; there is a providence, and the hand of God in it, which led mine thus far, that you might lay it to heart.</p>
               <p>Indeed (Sir) theſe are but outward things; there are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpiritual, and eternal truths, I purpoſed to preſent to your ſerious thoughts, that is, the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> coming down from God out of Heaven: what the Lord has taught me therein, I cannot now expreſs, only to tell you, that I teach nothing now to man, but the new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in which when the Saints ſhall be gathered, as they ſhall all be one (for there's but one ſtreet in that City) ſo there being no Temple there, but the Lord God and the Lamb, the divided forms of Church-worſhip (being fallen with <hi>Babylon</hi>) ſhall appear no more; but God will be ſeen to dwell in his people, with that light and love, that many Nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord (in them, 'tis not ſaid joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them now) for God ſhall be all in all.</p>
               <p>This I call the third Diſpenſation, differing from Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-order, yet comprehending both &amp; above both; for <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:118240:20"/>is above; and that was above to the higheſt Apoſtle, will come downe and appear to the leaſt and loweſt of Gods people,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.26.</note> for 'tis the mother of us all; yea the child ſhall dye a hundred years old,<note place="margin">Iſa. 65.20. Eph. 4.13.</note> for the leaſt child of God ſhall come to a perfect man, to the fulneſs of the ſtature of Chriſt; that is, ſhall ſee himſelf fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the fulneſs of God, as the moſt perfect man on earth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p>This third diſpenſation, or third diſcovery of God, all the Prophets did write of,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.18, 23.</note> and all the Apoſtles waited for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be revealed in us, the glorious liberty of the ſons of God, ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 3.2.</note> the appearing of God (even the glorious appearing of the great God in us) when we ſhall be like him, and ſee him as he is, ſaith <hi>Iohn;</hi> the new heaven and the new earth, ſaith <hi>Peter;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.13.</note> all this we wait for, ſay they: and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw it coming down, even the new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> after <hi>Babylons</hi> fall.</p>
               <p>The fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> will be by confuſion: when this comes to the Churches, and in the Spirits of the Saints, they ſhall then begin to ſee, what before they were blind unto; yea the blind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhall ſee, for they that ſee ſhall be made blind, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.39. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.18.</p>
               <p>But this is the comfort to me and many with me, that as the eares of the deaf ſhall hear the words of the book; ſo the eyes of the blind ſhall ſee out of obſcurity, and out of darkneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.18, 19.</p>
               <p>This Scripture I ſpake of at <hi>Brecknock,</hi> the laſt firſt day. The Book, I ſhewed, was God dwelling in men, <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us, that's Chriſt, God in us; God manifeſt in our fleſh, as in his, is Chriſt in us the hope of glory; for all the Saints ſhall be taken up into the ſame glory with himſelf, and the Nations by this called, and joyned to the Lord.</p>
               <p>This Book is ſealed to the learned and unlearned Preachers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.11. yea to the Prophets and Seers, and moſt ſeeing men; yea ſealed with ſeven ſeals; that's perfectly ſealed, and from all Churches; for it relates to the ſeven Churches enclining to the Apoſtacie which followed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis but a ſma book, a very little one; for <hi>Iohn</hi> could ſwallow it at a bit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. and 'twas bitter in his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118240:20"/>'tis ſo to fleſh, for it ſuffers by it, as Chriſts did; but the little Book is no more then God manifeſt in fleſh, in his fleſh, and in ours,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It ſhall be open, and that ſurely; for the miniſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, fully known; and the Angel ſweares by God, that time ſhall be no more; for all ſhall be taken up into eternity, into God himſelf, and God ſhall be all in all.</p>
               <p>I ſhall repeat no more; onely the remembrance of the Lord, and his love to me, in your dear deceaſed Wife, who lives with me and in me; for there's the Lord in whom ſhe is, and in whom we both are, though we know not; but we ſhall, when the book ſhall be opened. My deareſt ſalutes to all the Saints with you. Farewell.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Am owing to you in much love, and in a Letter you long ſince ſent unto me, but now I ſhall repay you an anſwer; which I had not ſo fit an opportunity to returne, till by the preſent bearer. I do not remember the contents of that; onely I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, 'twas ſomething concerning Chriſt, and 'tis that alone I ſhall in this confer with you; for your Church-fellowſhip is at an end, with God; though ſome men may ſee ſomewhat in it, yet 'tis but a dead carcaſe they look upon, the form of a man; but the Spirit, life, and power form on high appears not at all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118240:21"/>to me, nor to many in it; as I have hinted in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Moſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not to direct you in preaching, but to deſire your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts in the things you ſpake of, the perſonal reigne of Chriſt; which with confidence you declare to be in that fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſence of his, with which he aſcended, and ſhall ſo deſcend to reign a thouſand years on earth, and the Saints with him.</p>
               <p>This hath ſome ſhew in the Letter of Scripture; but if the Spirit hid in your fleſh, and mine, ſhall be ſuffered to come forth, and truely to interpret, without the Tradition and Teaching of men, God may ſhew you another ſenſe, then what is commonly revealed by Chriſtians and Churches.</p>
               <p>The firſt ground whereon your foundation, or fundamental doctrine ſtands is, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into Heaven? this ſame Ieſus which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall come ſo in like manner, as yee have ſeen him go into Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this, know, that the Diſciples of Chriſt were too much taken with his fleſhly preſence, while he was living with them in the dayes of his fleſh;<note place="margin">John 16.7. Joh. 20.13, 20.</note> and his departure from them, or dying of fleſh, filled their hearts with ſorrow; as after he was raiſed, thoſe who were weeping at his grave,<note place="margin">John 20.17.</note> rejoyced to ſee him in the fleſh again, and ſo to touch him; but that muſt not be, ſaith he, till I am aſcended; and this touch could not be, but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that in them was to take and touch the Spirit in him.</p>
               <p>And what was he, even Jeſus? but God manifeſt in fleſh; for 'twas God who roſe and aſcended up on high,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.19, 30. Joh. 8.27, 28. Joh. 14.9, 10. compare. Pſal. 68.1, 18.</note> that's God in fleſh: and what was his coming? but when that Spirit and power of God in his fleſh, ſhould appear in theirs, the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came again; for as the ſhedding forth of all the Gifts of the Spirit on the Diſciples, was the ſame: ſo Chriſt tells <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuting the Saints (or the Spirit rather in them) I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.5.</p>
               <p>Jeſus was therefore come again; for his coming that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, 'twas nothing but the promiſe of the Father which they heard of him, and in him; for as the Father was all in all in his fleſh, who dwelt and did all his works, ſpake his words: ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118240:21"/>when God even the Father ſhould appear thus with power in their fleſh, as in his, then he came indeed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that believeth on me (ſaith he) the works that I do, ſhall he do alſo, and greater works then theſe ſhall he do; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I go to the Father.</hi> His going to the Father was his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance in fleſh; for when he no longer appeared to them in fleſh then he was ſaid to depart; therefore his coming again was in the Spirit: when he, who was with them, ſhould be in them, then Chriſt was the Spirit the quickning Spirit: becauſe I live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye ſhall live alſo, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.17, 19. thus Chriſt was the Comforter, verſe 16. called another Comforter, becauſe he came in another preſence then that of fleſh; he came, and yet was he the ſame Comforter; for I will not leave you comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I will come to you, verſe 18. <hi>yet a little while, and the world ſeeth me no more, but ye ſee me,</hi> &amp;c. the world, that's carnal Chriſtians, could ſee no more of Chriſt, when his <hi>fleſhly preſence</hi> was gone; but <hi>ye ſee me,</hi> ye who are ſpiritual, or when ſpiritual: ye ſee me; how? ſure in the Spirit, in the Spirit of life, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and in the Spirit of light or knowledge, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>At that day ye ſhall know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> No more Chriſt in the fleſh, but in the Father, and Chriſt no more to be known after the fleſh, but he in us, and we in him.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritual underſtanding of Chriſt, the diſciples while car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal (yea while Chriſt was in the fleſh) were ignorant of; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he calls them in a common name, <hi>Ye men of Galilee,</hi> Acts 1.11. and their gaping up to heaven after his fleſhly preſence, is reproved there alſo. The ſpiritual knowledge of him is then taught: <hi>This ſame Ieſus which is taken from you</hi> (in the fleſh) <hi>ſhall ſo come unto you</hi> (in the ſpirit:) and ye ſhall <hi>ſee him,</hi> (as was ſaid before, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19.) that is, <hi>after a little while</hi> they ſhould <hi>ſee him,</hi> Joh. 16.17.) This <hi>little while</hi> cannot be at the end of the world, after ſo many hundreds of yeers to be ſeen in a fleſhly appearence; but <hi>not many days hence,</hi> that's a little while, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>Yea, but how was this <hi>in the like manner?</hi> for they ſaw
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118240:22"/>him go up in the fleſh; true, but they ſaw not the fulneſs of the Spirit dwelling in that fleſh after 'twas raiſed; but when he ſhould aſcend and give gifts unto men, then God who received gifts in the man (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> reads <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18.) appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Saints and in their fleſh, with that Spirit and power that was in Chriſt, is ſaid to come: and thus in the ſame ſenſe, or in the like manner, Jeſus came, as they ſaw him go up to heaven.</p>
               <p>Indeed he was taken up in the Cloud; but the Cloud was to take him out of their ſight, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9. to take his fleſhly preſence out of their ſight: this they would fain ſee ſtill, but ſhould not, verſe 10. and he will come again in a Cloud; that is in our fleſh, when moſt confuſed and darke (for ſo the Diſciples were, before the Spirit came at firſt.) The comfort is at his ſecond coming; when in our fleſh we are moſt cloudy, dark confuſed Chriſt will come (or appear in us) with more majeſty, power, and glory, in the glory of the Father in us.</p>
               <p>Yea the Apoſtles themſelves dream'd of a perſonal raigne of Chriſt, or reſtoring the Kingdome to <hi>Iſrael, Act.</hi> 1.6. <hi>But 'tis not for you to know the times and ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his owne power; but ye ſhall receive power after that the holy Spirit is come upon you,</hi> verſe 7. Mark, I pray you, how the times and ſeaſons (of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him) was in the Fathers power; this they were not to know, nor could they, while carnal; but when the power of the holy Spirit came upon them, they ſhould then know the Kingdome reſtored to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had received power from on high; for the Kingdome of God is within us.</p>
               <p>This, my dear Brother, ſhall be made know to you and me, that the Kingdome of God comes not by outward obſervation; but ſeeing the Spirit ſhall againe be poured forth from on high, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.15. let us wait for this together, though our Palaces be forſaken, verſe 14. though our Church-fellowſhips and fleſh fall; for ſo 'twill be, before the Spirit come, verſe 9. to 13. for Chriſts pure fleſh was crucified through weakneſs, before he was raiſed in power, or received the Spirits fulneſs.</p>

               <p>Then ſhall we know the reign of Chriſt and of the Saints with him, for a thouſand years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4, 6. but as yet, what fleſhly thoughts and interpretations have paſſed over theſe words, by the Millenaries of old, and by many gratious Saints of late? what, is all the book of the Revelation a Myſtery? and muſt theſe one thouſand years onely be literally underſtood, juſt for ten hundred of years? and will not the Saints be more ſpiritual, but ſtill to think of a fleſhly reigne, a reigne of Chriſt after the fleſh, and of Saints after the fleſh? whereas, no man nor Chriſt is to be known ſo any more.</p>
               <p>And may not the one thouſand years be but one day, and that one day, the day of God? (when God ſhall appear) for that day is called one day, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.7. known to the Lord, to the Lord alone in us.</p>
               <p>Dear Sir, I ſhall leave but two things, and it may be a third, to your ſerious conſiderations. Firſt, you know the appearances of God, from the beginning, have been more and more ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and will be ſo to the end; how fleſhly and outward did he appear before, and under the Law, in viſible forms? In the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the preſence of the Lord, and his power, was more ſpiritual, in inward and eternal things; that is, in things not ſeen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18.</p>
               <p>Therefore the third diſpenſation (which Mr. <hi>Moſtons</hi> Letter tells you) will be more ſpiritual yet;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb. 5.7.</hi> who in the days of his fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that was when be was on earth, therefore his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in the Heaven, is all in the Spirit; for he is far above all heavens. <hi>Eph. 4.10.</hi>
                  </note> for though Chriſt was in the days of his fleſh, yet he was not fully come, till the Spirit was ſent; therefore this ſecond coming will be more in the Spirit yet; for the Apoſtles themſelves had but the firſt fruits of the Spirit; there will be a harveſt, a fuller meaſure of the Spirit, then was in the Apoſtles times, as the Prophets teſtifie, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.8.9.10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, doth not the reigne of Chriſt, which you hold forth in a fleſhly preſence, hinder the Saints from looking for the Spirit? that fulneſs of the Spirit, promiſed by all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to be poured forth in the laſt dayes? when he comes the ſecond time without ſin to ſalvation, with fulneſs of the Spirit in us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, doth not that preaching of yours, cauſe many Saints
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118240:23"/>to be more carnal, earthly, looking for a Kingdome here below; for they begin to reigne already as Kings, but not with Chriſt, nor in righteouſneſs, which is that alone (and not in forms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) that ſhall dwell in the new Heaven and new Earth, now waited for.</p>
               <p>My deareſt ſalutes and ſervice preſent to all the Saints with you: If I have not tyred your Spirit with theſe tedious lines, and if you ſhall pleaſe to interpret my love and enlarged affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein, with acceptance thereof, you will much more oblige</p>

                  <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Wrote unto you in <hi>Wales</hi> a few lines, in anſwer to yours Your judging of what I publikely ſpake, becauſe the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and worſt of men would hear me, was no argument with Chriſt, whom Publicanes and harlots willingly heard, and whom he friendly received, yea feaſted with, when Phariſees and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118240:27"/>were offended. Truly, Sir, I know your ſincerity and ſingleneſs of heart, yea your unſetledneſs and looſneſs of ſpirit from all Church-forms, and empty forms of godlineſs, waiting for a higher Power and Spirit to appear in the Saints, which will gather up not themſelves onely, but many Nations with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p>This is all I have taught my dear Country-men in <hi>Wales:</hi> yet indeed, Sir, I ſhould never have publiſhed this wilde Diſpute, but that I promiſed it on the place: for it was ſo confuſed, and full of Soloeciſms, and illogical proceeds, that if all particulars were written, it would nauſeate any Scholar, or ſpiritual man.</p>
               <p>Such a one I wiſht my Antagoniſt had been; for then he ſhould have underſtood me, or I him: therefore I deſired Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols</hi> in a Letter the week before, that we ſhould reaſon together in private, among Rational and Religious friends, both his and mine. But he was reſolved to have it in publike, either that the ſimple Welſh people might wonder at his wiſdom, or that his folly and mine might appear to all.</p>
               <p>And truely I was a fool to accept of a diſpute before an illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate multitude, and without a Moderator: for many ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would be ſpeaking at once.</p>
               <p>But it was agreed upon at laſt, that M. <hi>Nichols</hi> ſhould be Reſpondent, becauſe I was by Argument to maintain the Truth that I taught; which he had rumoured abroad to be Errour and Hereſie.</p>
               <p>The things were theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the new Jeruſalem is a ſtate of the Saints in this life.</hi> This he denied.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Saints this day have not a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faith.</hi> This he affirmed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That God is in union with mankinde.</hi> This he was negative too.</p>
               <p>But I was to maintain all three, in theſe following Arguments.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, I had many grounds to build upon, and to prove that the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> is a ſtate of Saints in this life. Firſt, becauſe it muſt be immediately after <hi>Babylons</hi> fall, which is in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118240:27"/>this liſe; where <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt fall, and riſe no more.<note place="margin">Rev. 18.21. Rev. 19. throughout. Rev. 20.1, 7. Rev. 21.2, 3.</note> Secondly, <hi>New Jeruſalem comes down from God out of heaven,</hi> not goes up to heaven from earth. Thirdly, there <hi>God dwells with men,</hi> not men with God: for 'tis a new earth, as well as a new heaven. Fourthly, <hi>whole Nations are here to be ſaved; and the Nations ſaved (with their Kings) bring their glory and honour to it:</hi> which cannot be in heaven above (as men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) but 'tis a third diſpenſation, differing from Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Order. For the firſt was <hi>a nation ſaved by the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 33.29. Act. 2.47. Zach. 2.11.</note> In the ſecond, <hi>believers of all Nations were ſaved,</hi> or joyned to the Lord: not to a Church, but to the Lord; not in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>form of Religion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 60.21.</note> but in <hi>the power of righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Argument was thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Nations of them that are ſaved, walk in the light of the new Jeruſalem;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 21.24.</note> 
                  <hi>and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>the new Jeruſalem is a ſtate of the Saints in this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall be inhabited,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>as a city without walls, for the multitude of men and cattel therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>'Tis in this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. <hi>Nichols</hi> Anſwers to both, truely I remember not, nor his to moſt of my Arguments; onely to this ſecond his anſwer was in <hi>laughter,</hi> (like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s wiſe man, <hi>Eccles</hi> 7.6.) crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud to the people, <hi>Hawer! here's cattel in heaven:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my proof was, that <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Zechariah</hi> was not heaven, becauſe cattel are there.</p>
               <p>Yet contrary to Order, Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> would needs object; and what? <hi>That the new Jeruſalem is not this life:</hi> why? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>none ſhall enter in that defileth, or telleth a lye,</hi> Rev. 21.27.</p>
               <p>I caught him preſently in three, before witneſſes. One was a great untruth: for whereas I was ſaying upon occaſion, that <hi>Zechariah</hi>'s prophecie was after the Captivity, M. <hi>Nichols</hi> would face me down before the people, that his Prophecie was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118240:28"/>before; and <hi>Adeodate</hi> (ſaith he) is of the ſame judgement with me.</p>
               <p>The next day that I ſpake, <hi>Adeodate</hi> was brought, and read in publike;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adeodate in</hi> Zach. 1.</note> whoſe words were quite contrary to that M. <hi>Nichols</hi> ſaid of him: yea, the Scripture is clear, that <hi>Zachary,</hi> propheſied in the ſecond and fourth yeers of <hi>Darius;</hi> that's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Captivity, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.1. &amp; 7.1. <hi>Ergo,</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>Mr. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols muſt not enter into the new Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twas his own Argument.<note place="margin">Iſa. 65.22.</note> But my third was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the new Jeruſalem men ſhall build houſes, plant vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards;</hi> labour, and live long.</p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>New Jeruſalem is a ſtate in this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that I held forth, as truth to me, was this: <hi>That none of the people of God this day have a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faith.</hi> Which I proved, firſt, by an Argument <hi>ex enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat is</hi> or <hi>ex particularibus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither M.</hi> Nichols, <hi>nor any of the godly Preachers with him, nor the people of God this day, have a Goſpel-Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>None have,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>'Twas proved thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe who live not of the Goſpel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>have not a Goſpel-faith</hi> (For, <hi>the juſt live by faith.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But neither M.</hi> Nichols, <hi>nor any of the godly Preachers with him live of the Goſpel:</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>The minor or ſecond Propoſition I proved thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe who live upon Tythes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.14.</note> 
                  <hi>live not of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But M.</hi> Nichols, <hi>and the reſt of the godly Preachers in</hi> Wales <hi>live upon Tythes:</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>This was unanſwerable; therefore to the people of God I propoſed a ſecond Argument, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe that have not received the Spirit which Jeſus gave after he was glorified have not a Goſpel faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 7.39.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Saints this day have not received that Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Ergo.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:118240:28"/>
               <p>This I proved,</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe that <hi>Spirit was not before given:</hi> or, (as the Greek there reads, <hi>The Spirit was not:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Spirit which the Apoſtles had before and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>breathed on them by Chriſt riſen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 14.17. John 20.22.</note> was not that Spirit which <hi>Jeſus gave when he was glorified,</hi> or aſcended: but the Saints this day have not that Spirit as the Apoſtles had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much leſs the Spirit which <hi>Jeſus gave after he was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the Spirit which <hi>Jeſus gave after he was glorified,</hi> was the <hi>Baptiſm of the Spirit</hi> (which the Apoſtles themſelves had not received before,<note place="margin">Act. 1.5.</note> till <hi>not many days after</hi> the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that is, the pouring forth of all the gifts of the Spirit on the Church;<note place="margin">Act. 2.33, 38.</note> which preſent Churches and pureſt Chriſtians are far from. <hi>Ergo, N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne have a Goſpel-faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Argument was from <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe who do not the works which Chriſt did, and greater alſo then thoſe, have not a Goſpel-faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But none of the Saints this day, by all their faith, can do thoſe works, and greater alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo.</p>
               <p>The Argument is ſtronger in Chriſt, who gives a double aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveration to it; <hi>Verily verily:</hi> that is, not onely aſſevers; but ſwears, as <hi>Calvin</hi> interprets, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe who believed on Chriſt, did greater works then he did in the days of his fleſh:<note place="margin">Act. 9.18. Act. 2.8, 41. Act. 4.4.</note> for ſome gave the Spirit by the laying on of hands. 2. Others could ſpeak to every one in his own tongue. 3. They converted many thouſands at once. 4. Could preach the Goſpel to every creature under heaven; whereas Chriſt did onely to one Nation;<note place="margin">Col. 1.23. Mat. 15.24. Mark. 6.4. Mark 16.17.18.</note> for his commiſſion was no farther. 2. Converted but a few. 3. Spake not with tongues. 4. Gave not the Spirit by laying on of hands, as the Apoſtles did, after Jeſus was glorified.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the weakeſt this day, I mean many of the ſcattered Saints, (who do not profeſs any Goſpel-faith to themſelves, yet
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118240:29"/>dare not deny it in them, (for there's a perfect confuſion, a <hi>Babel</hi> in their ſpirits, as in gathered Societies) I ſay, the weakeſt of ſcattered Saints this day do greater works then Chriſt did in the days of his fleſh; though the Spirit appear not in them nor they as doing thoſe works.</p>
               <p>For firſt, <hi>Babylons</hi> fall is by them: yea, <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, from firſt to laſt, has been ever laid lowe by the weakeſt of ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Saints;<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.5, 6. Zach. 12.7. Jer. 51.58.</note> while the gathered Churches in all Ages have been ſtill building <hi>Babylon</hi> a new, when and old Form or piece of the wall has been falling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the leaſt of the flock draws for <hi>Babylon,</hi> for utter deſtruction, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.45. yea, <hi>draw them out:</hi> whom? Saints out of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the weakeſt,<note place="margin">Iſa. 41.15. Jer. 51.20. Pſal. 149.8, 9. 1 Cor. 6.2, 3.</note> even <hi>worms do this day threſh moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, throw down hills, tear the rocks, and whole armies in pieces, break kingdoms, binde kings nobles, and judges,</hi> yea, <hi>judge the world, and angels</hi> of Churches: for the <hi>feeble</hi> (or <hi>fallen,</hi> Hebr.) <hi>is become as David, and the houſe of David as God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 12.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and the angel of the Lord before them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this we ſee done by the Saints this day, and the Saints thus to be, though they believe not: for now they begin to walk not by faith, but by ſight, (that's the third diſpenſation) which being full,<note place="margin">Iſa. 52.8. Rom. 8.18, 24. Rev. 22.4.</note> 
                  <hi>faith ſhall be ſwallowed up into viſion, hope into o poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> of that glory, wherein we ſhall <hi>ſee God as he is,</hi> ſee his face, and the Father's Name on our foreheads; yea, his Name ſo viſible and clear upon us, that all men ſhall ſee God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in us; and whole <hi>nations joyn to the Lord with us</hi> in that day.</p>
               <p>This was the laſt truth which I taught,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God is in union with mankinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I was about to prove by Argument, <hi>That God is in union with man:</hi> And this was all I taught the people. But M. <hi>Nichols</hi> fearing the Arguments that might follow, would needs perſwade, that I held <hi>a ſpiritual union between men and God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I never ſaid: but for Diſputes ſake, and to try the mans
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118240:29"/>ſtrength, I undertook to prove,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That union which is by the Spirit is a ſpiritual union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the union between God and mankinde is by the Spirit:</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>This he could neither ſtand againſt; therefore falls off fairly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Truth (ſaith he) the union is ſpiritual, but not of grace: God is not graciouſly united to All men.</p>
               <p>I was willing to follow the man, or the Lord in his weakneſs; therefore I replied again,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11.</note> 
                  <hi>hath appeared to All men:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>the grace of union is to all,</hi> or God graciouſly united to Mankinde.</p>
               <p>[This is that <hi>Philanthropie,</hi> or kindneſs and love of God our Saviour toward man, which appeared, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4.]</p>
               <p>This he grants again: and therefore cries quarter the third time. 'Tis of grace (ſaith he) there is a gracious union: but the union is not ſaving between God and all men or Mankinde.</p>
               <p>Here I would follow him no further, but left him in the flight, becauſe I foreſaw and Ambuſh laid before me, and that, in the ſalvation of all men, the man ſought my deſtruction. Therefore here the Diſpute ended; and we both departed in peace, as friends.</p>
               <p>But though I deſire not any Diſputes with men, yet I ſhall (with God) make it good in due time, <hi>That there is a Saving union between God and Mankinde:</hi> for,<note place="margin">Tir. 2.11.</note> 
                  <hi>the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to All men, hath appeared;</hi> (ſo the margin reads) and ſo I am ready to prove to all the world.</p>
